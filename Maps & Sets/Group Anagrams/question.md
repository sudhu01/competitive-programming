## Examples

### Example 1

**Input**

```text
strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
```

* There is no string in `strs` that can be rearranged to form `"bat"`.
* The strings `"nat"` and `"tan"` are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
* The strings `"ate"`, `"eat"`, and `"tea"` are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.

```

**Output**

```text
[["a"]]
