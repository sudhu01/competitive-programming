## Problem Statement

There is a street of length `x` whose positions are numbered `0, 1, …, x`. Initially there are no traffic lights, but `n` sets of traffic lights are added to the street one after another.

Your task is to calculate the length of the longest passage without traffic lights after each addition.

---

## Input

The first input line contains two integers `x` and `n`: the length of the street and the number of sets of traffic lights.

Then, the next line contains `n` integers `p₁, p₂, …, pₙ`: the position of each set of traffic lights. Each position is distinct.

---

## Output

Print the length of the longest passage without traffic lights after each addition.

## Constraints

* `1 ≤ x ≤ 10⁹`
* `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10⁵`
* `0 < pᵢ < x`
