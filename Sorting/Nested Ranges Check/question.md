# Nested Ranges Check

**[CSES](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/2168)**

---

## Statement

Given `n` ranges, your task is to determine for each range if it contains some other range and if some other range contains it.

Range `[a,b]` contains range `[c,d]` if `a ≤ c` and `d ≤ b`.

---

## Input

The first input line has an integer `n`: the number of ranges.

After this, there are `n` lines that describe the ranges. Each line has two integers `x` and `y`: the range is `[x,y]`.

You may assume that no range appears more than once in the input.

---

## Output

First print a line that describes for each range (in the input order) if it contains some other range (1) or not (0).

Then print a line that describes for each range (in the input order) if some other range contains it (1) or not (0).

## Constraints

- `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10⁵`
- `1 ≤ x < y ≤ 10⁹`
